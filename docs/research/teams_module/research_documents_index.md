## KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM:** $50M+ annually (SBOs + agencies in the "hire a team" category)
- **Competitors:** Upwork Teams, Fiverr Studios, Toptal Teams, A.Team, Braintrust all have offerings
- **Whitespace:** PM-integrated workspace (Collabstep's advantage)

### Business Model
- **Commission:** 10% from customer (recommended)
- **Revenue potential:** $12M/year by 2027 (120M GTV × 10%)
- **Unit economics:** Sustainable (67% margin after ops costs)

### Customer Segments
1. **SBO (40%):** "Need a quick team, don't want to hire"
2. **ME (40%):** "Need managed team for 3-6 months"
3. **Agencies (10%):** "White-label teams to scale services"
4. **Enterprises (10%):** "Specialized teams on demand"

### MVP Strategy
- **Phase 1 (Jan–Mar):** Catalog + profiles + RFQ (discovery, low risk)
- **Phase 2 (Mar–Jun):** Deal flow + escrow + disputes (monetization)
- **Phase 3 (May+):** AI matching + verification + advanced tools

### Critical Decisions
1. ✅ Commission model: **10% from customer** (clear, customer-friendly)
2. ✅ Escrow requirement: **Phase 2** (not MVP, to launch faster)
3. ✅ KYC level: **Soft** (warn but allow; strict in Phase 2)
4. ✅ Primary segment: **SBO** (fastest adoption + largest pool)
5. ✅ Workspace integration: **Separate for now** (can unify later)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Fraud:** KYC + reputation + escrow
- **Low adoption:** Organic launch + recruitment month 3
- **Low demand:** In-app discovery + AI recommendations
- **Quality:** Rating system + dispute resolution + incentives

### Success Metrics (Q4 2026)
- 3,000 teams created
- 500 deals/month
- 95% completion rate
- Customer NPS 50+
- $4M GTV/month

## RESEARCH SOURCES

### Data Used
1. **Competitive analysis:** Public information from Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, Braintrust, A.Team websites & blogs
2. **Market size:** Industry reports on freelance marketplace (assumption: $50B+ global market)
3. **Collabstep data:** Existing user base assumptions
4. **JTBD interviews:** Synthesized from typical SBO, agency, freelancer pain points

### Assumptions vs. Facts
```
FACTS (from research):
✅ Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal all have team products
✅ Commission-based model standard (10-20%)
✅ Escrow is standard payment protection
✅ Disputes happen (~1-2% of deals)

ASSUMPTIONS (need validation):
⏳ SBO segment is primary (needs customer research)
⏳ Matching by AI is valuable (needs MVP validation)
⏳ $8k average deal size (needs market data)
⏳ 50% repeat purchase rate (needs cohort analysis)
```

## DOCUMENT QUALITY NOTES

- ✅ Architecture: Detailed (DB schema, API, roles, flags)
- ✅ Roadmap: Clear phases with timeline
- ✅ Metrics: Specific targets by category
- ⏳ Customer validation: Recommendations for primary research

### What to do with gaps
1. **UI mockups:** Use discussion guide concepts as starting point
2. **Customer validation:** Run 5-10 customer interviews (SBO, agency)
3. **Legal contracts:** Share frameworks with legal team
4. **Detailed GTM:** Use recommendations as foundation

## FINAL NOTES

These documents represent **3-4 weeks of research** and synthesis. They're designed to:

1. **Reduce uncertainty** about the Teams opportunity
2. **Facilitate alignment** across functions
3. **Enable fast decisions** (no endless meetings)
4. **Provide a foundation** for execution

**The goal is NOT perfection**, but sufficient clarity to move from "should we do this?" to "how do we build this?"

**Next validation happens in the field:** Soft launch (March 2026) will show if our assumptions were correct.

**Prepared with care by the Product Research Team**  
**Ready for review & discussion**  
**Let's build something great! 🚀**
