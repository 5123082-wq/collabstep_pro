# COLLABSTEP Teams Module: Quick Reference Card

**Print this. Carry it. Reference it during discussions.**

---

## ONE-LINER

> "Teams module lets groups of freelancers/contractors offer complex services on Collabstep, with integrated PM workspace (projects, tasks, docs, chat). Differentiator: no need to go to Slack/email. Target: SBOs hiring teams vs. individuals."

---

## THE MARKET IN 30 SECONDS

| Segment | Market Size | Motivation |
|---------|---|---|
| **SBO (40%)** | $20M/year | Faster hiring, less coordination |
| **Medium Biz (40%)** | $20M/year | Scale without hiring |
| **Agencies (10%)** | $5M/year | White-label expansion |
| **Enterprise (10%)** | $5M/year | Specialized teams on demand |
| **TOTAL TAM** | **$50M+/year** | **Proven demand (Upwork, Toptal have this)** |

---

## COMPETITION AT A GLANCE

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | How We Win |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Upwork Teams** | Large network | Generic UI, no special workspace | PM-integrated workspace |
| **Fiverr Studios** | Easy to join | Limited to fixed-price gigs | Complex project mgmt |
| **Toptal Teams** | High quality | Slow (5-7 days), expensive | Fast (48h), transparent |
| **A.Team** | Curated, community | Expensive, niche | Broader, affordable |
| **Braintrust** | Low fees (crypto) | Risky, complex | Fiat currency, simple |

**Key insight:** We're not inventing the wheel. We're making it better (faster, integrated, transparent).

## BUSINESS MODEL (SIMPLIFIED)

```
Customer posts project → System matches teams → Team quotes → Deal closed → Team works in workspace → Customer approves → Collabstep gets 10%

Example:
├─ Customer hires team for $10k website project
├─ Collabstep takes 10% = $1,000 commission
├─ Team keeps $9,000 (minus Stripe fees 2.9%)
└─ Collabstep profit: ~$700 per deal (after ops)

Scale:
├─ 500 deals/month × $10k avg = $5M GTV
├─ Collabstep: $500k/month revenue
└─ Profit (at scale): $400k/month net
```

## MVP SCOPE (WHAT'S IN PHASE 1, WHAT'S NOT)

### ✅ MUST HAVE (Phase 1: Jan–Mar 2026)

| Feature | Why | Timeline |
|---------|-----|----------|
| Team catalog (searchable) | Core discovery | Week 1-2 |
| Team profiles | Trust building | Week 3-4 |
| Team member visibility | Credibility | Week 3-4 |
| RFQ (Request for Quote) flow | Core job posting | Week 5-6 |
| Team notifications | Engagement | Week 5-6 |
| Basic rating system | Feedback loop | Week 7-8 |

**Phase 1 doesn't include:**
- ❌ Payments (Phase 2)
- ❌ Escrow (Phase 2)
- ❌ Disputes (Phase 2)
- ❌ AI matching (Phase 3)
- ❌ Time tracking (Phase 3)

**Why this scope?**
- Fast to launch (10 weeks)
- Low risk (no money moves)
- Validates demand
- Feeds Phase 2 (deal flow)

---

## CRITICAL DECISIONS (WITH RECOMMENDATIONS)

**Decision 1: Who pays the 10% commission?**
```
Option A: Customer (simplest)
└─ Customer budget: $10k → pays $11k total ($10k + 10% fee)
└─ Team gets: $10k

Option B: Team (seems fairer but complex)
└─ Customer budget: $10k → pays $10k
└─ Team gets: $9k (net after 10% commission)

RECOMMENDATION: Option A
Why: Customer-friendly (no surprises), easier to explain
```

**Decision 2: Require escrow in MVP?**
```
Option A: Yes (safer, but slower deals)
Option B: No (faster, but trust issues)

RECOMMENDATION: No in Phase 1, yes in Phase 2
Why: Phase 1 is discovery + RFQ only (no payments). Phase 2 (May onward) adds escrow.
```

## RED FLAGS (RISKS)

| Risk | Flag | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Low team adoption** | <500 teams in 8 weeks | Activate recruitment (outbound) |
| **Low customer demand** | <100 RFQs in 2 months | In-app prompts, marketing |
| **High fraud** | >5% dispute rate | Stronger KYC, escrow sooner |
| **Slow quotes** | >72h average | Penalties for slow teams, templates |
| **Competitor response** | Upwork launches equivalent | Move fast, emphasize PM integration |

## COMMUNICATION (ELEVATOR PITCH)

**For customers:**
> "Hire a complete team for your project—not individual freelancers. Get a quote in 48 hours, work together in one place, and know who you're working with. No coordination headaches, just results."

**For teams:**
> "Earn more by teaming up. Post your team, get project opportunities, and keep all communication and tasks in Collabstep. Build reputation together."

**For investors:**
> "Teams module unlocks a $50M+ market segment we're currently missing. Toptal's Teams is 30% of their revenue. We can capture 5% of that by 2027 = $12M annual revenue."

## COMMON QUESTIONS & QUICK ANSWERS

**Q: Isn't this just copying Upwork Teams?**  
A: Upwork Teams is a generic feature in a job marketplace. We're building dedicated product with PM integration. Different enough to win.

**Q: What if we get fraud? (Fake teams)**  
A: Phase 1 has no payments, so fraud cost is low. Phase 2 adds KYC + escrow. Phase 2+ adds verification + manual review for high-value deals.

**Q: Will Upwork / Toptal crush us?**  
A: They're slower to innovate (legacy codebases). We can move faster and differentiate on PM integration. They might copy us, but we'll be ahead.

**Q: When do we make money?**  
A: Phase 2 (June). Phase 1 is free to build trust + volume. By Dec 2026, we'll have $4M GTV/month.

**Q: What if it doesn't work?**  
A: Kill it (Phase 1 sunk cost: $200k). But based on Toptal, A.Team, Braintrust success, we're confident demand is real.
