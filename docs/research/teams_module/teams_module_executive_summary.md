# COLLABSTEP Teams Module: Executive Summary (One-Page)

**Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Prepared by:** Product Research Team  
**For:** Leadership / Stakeholder Decision

---

## WHAT IS THIS?

Module to enable **groups of freelancers/contractors to form teams** and offer complex services on Collabstep. Differentiator: integrated with PM workspace (projects, tasks, documents, chat).

**Example:**
- 3 developers + 1 designer form "TechStudio Team"
- Customers can "Request Quote" for a website redesign
- Deal happens entirely in Collabstep workspace (no Slack/email needed)
- Team gets 90% of payment; Collabstep gets 10% commission

---

## WHY NOW?

| Market Signal | Implication |
|---|---|
| **Upwork/Fiverr growing team segments** | Demand is real (not niche) |
| **Toptal's "Teams" is their growth engine** | B2B SaaS (enterprises) want "managed teams" |
| **Braintrust (decentralized) raising $M** | This is a crowded, competitive space |
| **Collabstep has PM-core built** | Unique advantage vs. pure marketplaces |

**Opportunity:** If we launch Teams well, it becomes 20-30% of platform revenue by 2027.

---

## TARGET MARKET (Initial Focus)

**Primary: Small Businesses (SBO)**
- Budget: $2k–$10k per project
- Pain: "Need a website/app but don't know which freelancer to trust"
- Solution: "Book a vetted team (not a solo)"

**Secondary: Agencies**
- Pain: "How do I scale without hiring?"
- Solution: "White-label teams from Collabstep"

**Opportunity:** 500+ SBOs on Collabstep likely to hire teams (TAM: easily $50M+ annually).

---

## BUSINESS MODEL

| Metric | Numbers |
|---|---|
| Commission | 10% of deal value (customer pays) |
| Average deal | $8,000 |
| Gross margin | 80-85% (after payment processing) |
| Year 1 revenue target (Phase 2 end) | $5M GTV → $500k net revenue |
| CAC (per team) | ~$50-100 (organic) |
| CAC (per customer deal) | ~$200-300 (through marketing) |

---

## MVP SCOPE (Jan–Mar 2026, 10 weeks)

**MUST HAVE:**
- ✅ Team catalog + profiles (searchable)
- ✅ Basic team info (name, members, portfolio, rating)
- ✅ "Request for Quote" flow
- ✅ Team notification + response
- ✅ No payments yet (Phase 2)

**NOT in Phase 1:**
- ❌ AI matching (need data first)
- ❌ Escrow / full deal flow (Phase 2)
- ❌ Multi-currency (Phase 3)
- ❌ Time tracking (Phase 3)

**Launch Target:** March 28, 2026 (soft launch 5% users)

---

## CRITICAL DECISIONS (Need To Make)

| Decision | Impact | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Who pays commission?** | Revenue model | Customer 10% | Team 10% | Split 5/5 |
| **Require payment escrow in MVP?** | Trust & friction | Yes (MVP) | No (Phase 2) | Optional |
| **KYC requirement** | Fraud/compliance | Strict | Soft warning | Optional |
| **Primary customer segment** | GTM focus | SBO | Agencies | Both |
| **Workspace integration** | Tech complexity | Unified | Separate | TBD |

**Recommendation:** Commission from customer 10% (cleaner economics). Soft escrow (Phase 2). Focus SBO first.

## RECOMMENDATION

### GO for Phase 1 MVP (Jan–Mar 2026)

**Why:**
1. **Market opportunity:** Large, underserved (teams vs. solos)
2. **Competitive moat:** PM-core integration unique vs. Upwork/Fiverr
3. **Economics:** 10% commission = $12M revenue opportunity (2027)
4. **Risk manageable:** Phase 1 is low-risk (discovery + RFQ, no payments)
5. **Timing:** Competitors growing now (Upwork Enterprise, Toptal Teams)

**Conditions:**
- [ ] Secure engineering + product team (4 people, full-time)
- [ ] Legal review contract template + escrow T&Cs (by Feb 1)
- [ ] Clear decision on commission model (by Jan 20)
- [ ] Green light on payment processor partnership (by Jan 25)

### Don't Launch Phase 1 If:
- ❌ We're not willing to invest 4+ FTE for 3 months
- ❌ We're unclear on commission economics
- ❌ Payment processing partner not aligned
- ❌ Legal/compliance blockers exist (tax, escrow, disputes)
